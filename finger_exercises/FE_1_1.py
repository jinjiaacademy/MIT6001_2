Computers can be annoyingly literal. If you don't tell them exactly what you want them to do,
they are likely to do the wrong thing. Try writing an algorithm for driving between two destinations.
Write it the way you would for a person, and then imagine what would happen if that person were
as stupid as a computer, and executed the algorithm exactly as written.
