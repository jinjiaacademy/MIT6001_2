Finger exercise: In a vacuum, the speed of a falling object is defined
by the equation v = v0 + gt, where v0 is the initial velocity of the object,
t is the number of seconds the object has been falling, and g is the
gravitational constant, roughly 9.8 m/sec2 on the surface of the Earth
and 3.711 m/ sec2 on Mars. A scientist measures the velocity of a falling
object on an unknown planet. She does this by measuring the downward
velocity of an object at different points in time. At time 0, the object
has an unknown velocity of v0. Implement a function that fits a model to
the time and velocity data and estimates g for that planet and v0 for the
experiment. It should return its estimates for g and v0, and also r-squared
for the model.
