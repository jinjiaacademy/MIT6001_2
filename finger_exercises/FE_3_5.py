The Empire State Building is 102 stories high. A man wanted to know the highest floor
from which he could drop an egg without the egg breaking. He proposed to drop an egg 
from the top floor. If it broke, he would go down a floor, and try it again. He would 
do this until the egg did not break. At worst, this method requireds 102 eggs. Implement
a method that at worst uses seven eggs.
